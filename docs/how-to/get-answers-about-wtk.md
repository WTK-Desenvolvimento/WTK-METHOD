## Start Here: Wtk-Help

**The fastest way to get answers about Wtk is the `wtk-help` skill.** This intelligent guide will answer upwards of 80% of all questions and is available to you directly in your IDE as you work.

Wtk-Help is more than a lookup tool — it:
- **Inspects your project** to see what's already been completed
- **Understands natural language** — ask questions in plain English
- **Varies based on your installed modules** — shows relevant options
- **Auto-runs after workflows** — tells you exactly what to do next
- **Recommends the first required task** — no guessing where to start

### How to Use Wtk-Help

Call it by name in your AI session:

```
wtk-help
```

:::tip
You can also use `/wtk-help` or `$wtk-help` depending on your platform, but just `wtk-help` should work everywhere.
:::

Combine it with a natural language query:

```
wtk-help I have a SaaS idea and know all the features. Where do I start?
wtk-help What are my options for UX design?
wtk-help I'm stuck on the PRD workflow
wtk-help Show me what's been done so far
```

Wtk-Help responds with:
- What's recommended for your situation
- What the first required task is
- What the rest of the process looks like

## When to Use This Guide

Use this section when:
- You want to understand Wtk's architecture or internals
- You need answers outside of what Wtk-Help provides
- You're researching Wtk before installing
- You want to explore the source code directly

## Steps

### 1. Choose Your Source

| Source               | Best For                                  | Examples                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **`_wtk` folder**   | How Wtk works—agents, workflows, prompts | "What does the PM agent do?" |
| **Full GitHub repo** | History, installer, architecture          | "What changed in v6?"        |
| **`llms-full.txt`**  | Quick overview from docs                  | "Explain Wtk's four phases" |

The `_wtk` folder is created when you install Wtk. If you don't have it yet, clone the repo instead.

### 2. Point Your AI at the Source

**If your AI can read files (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.):**

- **Wtk installed:** Point at the `_wtk` folder and ask directly
- **Want deeper context:** Clone the [full repo](https://github.com/wtk-code-org/WTK-METHOD)

**If you use ChatGPT or Claude.ai:**

Fetch `llms-full.txt` into your session:

```text
https://wtk-code-org.github.io/WTK-METHOD/llms-full.txt
```


### 3. Ask Your Question

:::note[Example]
**Q:** "Tell me the fastest way to build something with Wtk"

**A:** Use Quick Flow: Run `wtk-quick-dev` — it clarifies your intent, plans, implements, reviews, and presents results in a single workflow, skipping the full planning phases.
:::

## What You Get

Direct answers about Wtk—how agents work, what workflows do, why things are structured the way they are—without waiting for someone else to respond.

## Tips

- **Verify surprising answers** — LLMs occasionally get things wrong. Check the source file or ask on Discord.
- **Be specific** — "What does step 3 of the PRD workflow do?" beats "How does PRD work?"

## Still Stuck?

Tried the LLM approach and still need help? You now have a much better question to ask.
